# Thorne ComputerCraft
A small collection of useful programs and apis.

To download ThorneCC and play some music, plop down a computer, a CCTweaked Speaker, and plug in the following lines:
```
wget https://shelbykauth.github.io/ThorneCC/src/downloadThorne.lua
downloadThorne
ThorneCC/programs/MidiPlayer.lua
ThorneCC/programs/MusicPlayer.lua
```
Midi Player is the one most people will find the most useful.
Music Player was the first one I made.  And it's easier to follow the code, but severely limited.

For now, everything is kind of a [WIP].
Those without [WIP] or listed further down are merely functional

### APIs
+ BenchmarkAPI - for benchmarking functions
+ GUI - for making player-terminal interactions easier
+ MusicAPI - for playing some tunes
+ MidiAPI - for playing some real tunes
+ [WIP] StorageAPI - for inventory and storage
+ ThorneAPI - base functions included in all the rest

### Programs
+ downloadThorne - for downloading new versions of the system.
+ [WIP] SimpleStorage
+ MidiPlayer - careful.  It's easy to get too much filespace used up.  You may need to pick and choose your songs wisely.

## Planned Features

### APIS
+ ThorneBot
+ UserAuth

### Programs
+ Turtle Bartender
+ Player Shops
+ Bank
+ Turtle Slaves
+ And So Much More!!!
